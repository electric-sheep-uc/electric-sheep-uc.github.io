## Funding

`Last Modfified: 2018-09-22`

We are happy to announce that we have been awarded funds to establish a RoboCup
team by the University of Canterbury's College of Engineering, for the purpose
of purchasing three robots and a practice environment. It is our hope that over
the next year we will be able to successfully build a humanoid platform and
compete in RoboCup 2019, hosted in Australia [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4].

It is our hope to establish a strong robotics team and compete in this
prestigious event, allowing us to showcase the recent advancements in robotics
out of the labs and add to these ourselves. New Zealand has great potential for
robots in many applications, including agriculture, search & rescue and
autonomous vehicles as just a few examples.

The RoboCup competition is a particularly exciting opportunity, bringing talent
from around the world to compete in one of the next big steps in robotics,
requiring multiple disciplines to come together in order to achieve this great
task. This ambitious goal has been globally sponsored by big names such as
Flower Robotics, SoftBank Robotics, Festo and MathWorks - as well as being
partnered with the IEEE Robotic and Automation Society [^5].
