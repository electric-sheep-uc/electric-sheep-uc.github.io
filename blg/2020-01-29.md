In this video update we show a quick overview on our design process for
upgrading the leg motors and increasing the movement in the models. In our
previous design, the motors were too weak for proper robot walking and the
movement made getting up from a fallen state quite difficult. To overcome this,
we have upgraded from Feetech SM30s to Feetech SM40BLs, which offer 40kg/cm
from the previous 30kg/cm (which we tested). Other improvements include better
gearing, increased accuracy, less overheating and better build quality.
