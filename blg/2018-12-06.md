## Qualification 2019

`Last Modfified: 2018-12-06`

It certainly has been a busy few months! We've gone from some
[hardware on a desk](hardware.html), all the way to proudly presenting our
first platform, *Black Sheep*. Other than being sheep related, it's also a
platform that will likely never feel the field under it's feet as we plan to
have several more iterations over the next six months, in preparation for the
world cup.

Our changes come in many part to the hardware and software: some fixes, some
improvements and some feature implementations. In the next month or so we
prioritize the fixes and improvements to our humanoid platform.

You may also view our [team description paper](/bin/tdp.pdf) and the
[robot specification](/bin/specs.pdf) for an in depth discussion about where we
are and where we're going.

Stay tuned for more updates!
