<h2 id="qualification-2020-preparation">Qualification 2020 Preparation</h2>
<p><code>Last Modfified: 2019-10-20</code></p>
<p>This blog update is to provide a simplistic overview of what is required for qualification - more information can be found on the official <a href="https://mailman.cc.gatech.edu/pipermail/robocup-humanoid/2019/001546.html">mailing list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-qualification">What Is Qualification?</h3>
<p>The purpose of the qualification stage is to filter for the best teams to participate in the competition. This is to ensure a basic level of competence, so that games are interesting and teams are able to play. In order to compete at the competition, teams must pass the qualification process.</p>
<p>At the competition itself, the robots are inspected to ensure compliance with the rules - so even after qualification, participation is not guaranteed. As well as checking the robot dimensions and limb manoeuvrability, robots must also demonstrate the ability to get up from a fall in both the frontwards and backwards orientations.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-qualify">How Do You Qualify?</h3>
<p>Teams must provide several formal pieces of information in order to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team Data</strong> - This consists of the basic team information, such as a name, website and contact details.</li>
<li><strong>Robot Video</strong> - The video needs to demonstrate the robot finding a ball, walking towards a ball, positioning for a kick, kicking towards a goal and getting up from a fallen state.</li>
<li><strong>Software Description</strong> - This is a series of questions about the code, specifically the walking, vision, localization, communication, behaviour and contributions made.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Abstract</strong> - Two page of details about upgrades since the previous year and what makes the robot team great.</li>
<li><strong>Letter Of Commitement</strong> - This is a signed letter by each team leader to say they will do their duties to help the competition run smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Robot Specification</strong> - One page overview of the robot hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deadlines-announced">Deadlines Announced</h3>
<p>The technical committee have sent out the following deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission system open: <em>November 18th, 2019</em></li>
<li>Deadline for submission: <em>December 2nd, 2019</em></li>
<li>Announcement of qualified teams: <em>January 20th, 2020</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plan-of-action">Plan Of Action</h3>
<p>Over the next few months, we hope to provide some details in a series of blogs about what our team gets up to leading to the qualification deadline.</p>
